<p style="color: #d9c9af;">This class has been very intersting. Coding isn't a strong suit that I have, but from what
     I have learned, I am now able to not only create something new, but can understand it...somewhat. The is a lot to
     coding as a whole, and perhaps one day I may come back to it. I've learned so much from this class. From the 
     basic funadmentals of HTML to the history of where it all began.
     </p>

<p style="color: #d9c9af;">With finals around the corner, it's been a little difficult to try and get everything
     done. Honestly, it feels easier to just let everything go, but I can't do that. I have a BFA to obtain with
     plans of an MFA right after. Who knows...maybe one of my portfolio works will have some coding in it.

<p style="color: #d9c9af;">Best,
