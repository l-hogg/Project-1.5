<body style="background-color: #0d161c;">
     <p>Hello world. This is the next weekly for the semester. We have now looked into JavaScript.
I know a little about this, but it has been a while. During community college, I took a class on 
web design class which focused on Java. We even used the p5.js, so it's a little familiar.
     </p>

     <p>
     I am excited to see how this can be used to build my website. Which I am still going for an
old timey feel to it, but I think leaning towards an ARG mode would be really cool. I do love story
telling. Perhaps I can continue the "Farm House" story that I built. Continuing that would be really
interesting. I did like that flashlight effect someone in class did...I think that would be amazing!!
     </p>
