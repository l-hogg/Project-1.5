<h1>Weekly: d</h1>
     <h2>09-24-2023</h2>

<body style="background-color: #0d161c;">
     <p>This week has been...slow at best. At least in the way of classwork. 
The poem I worked with was something I wrote in 2019, during a rough time of my
life, and using poety to speak my mind. This was one of mildest of poems, and 
probably is one of my faves as it speaks of my time when the chaos didn't matter.
All that mattered was I was having fun with my best friend, which I hadn't done 
in a while that that point. 
     </p>
     <p>In other news, I got to attend the Renissance Fair with some friends
which was a lot of fun. The area felt very "Middle ages" which was the whole point.
There were a lot of people who dressed up. Some in plaid, some in armour, others in
blown-up dragon outfits. It was a lot of fun, with amazing artworks, craftings, and 
of course, the food. They sold a variety of food from Turkey leggs to Crepes. I did
think about drinking alcohol, but two things blocked me; types of alcohol and long lines.
As with any event, lines can be a nightmare, which is why I didn't really go for it. And 
yes...it's a bummer. I wish...but that's okay. I still had fun.
     </p>
     <p>In the news of work, things we rather interesting. As in Sign Shop - the 
section of the CABS that works with stops for the buses, and shuttles - where someone
had broken one of the windows at a sheltered stop on 11th ave. What was awful was the 
fact that the glass was on the verge of shattering. And by shattering I mean, crumbling
into pieces. It took me nearly 2 hours to sweep up alone. It sucked, but hey...it's work.
