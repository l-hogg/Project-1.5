<p style="color: #d9c9af;">Oh boy...the beginning of a forgotten skill obtained years prior in a class for my Associates of Arts, Web Design.
     It has been a while since I've done something like this. Slowly, but Shirley <i>don't call me Shirley</i> this will 
     come back to me. If you got that referrence, you're an OG. If you didn't, then you're in for a hilarious ride 
     with <b>Lesley Nielsen</b> He movies always make me laugh. Then again, nothing beats a classic slap-stick.

     His most iconic movies; "Naken Gun" and "Airplane" are simply a must see for all. 

     </p>
<br>
<p style="color: #d9c9af;">Back to coding, I have actually done some items of it before college. In both the world of DeviantArt and ToyHouse
     you are able to build proilfes, posts, and portfolios using these base HTML commands. I never really understood it 
     before, but once I began classes, it made life a little easier. 
</p>

<p style="color: #d9c9af;">I'm still not sure what to do for the next project. The "make your own adventure". I do love those kind of games
     so maybe I'll go for something like that. I love to tell stories, it's one of the reasons I'm getting my BFA.
     I want to create a whole story, which will become a graphic novel eventually, but right now, I need to research 
     as this story is going to be an Historical Fiction. I already know how it will begin and end, which difficult 
     for any writer, but because of history...I need to research. A lot. Good thing I love history, right? But for this 
     project, I think I want to have a littl fun with it. Make it a fantasy, or maybe a sci-fi...? Horror..? So many
     choices to choose from.

     Oh well...I've still got time to figure things out.
