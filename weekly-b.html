     <h4>September 1 2023</h4>

     <body style="background-color: #0d161c;">
     <p>This week has been eventful in the terms of coding.
     It may be muscle memory, or perhaps I'm slowly getting this coding thing.
     It's become easier to type things out, and the understanding of <i>enphasising</i> words.
     The next step is dealing with CSS. I think it will be a little challenging with all the ways it can be typed.
     </p>
     <p>What was also fun was making the homework assignment, which something I didn't think I'd ever really say/type.
     The assignment allowed us to link pages together. In this case, I got a little carried away.
     I love to make up stories, and I decided to work on a "plan your own adventure" focusing on a group of friends in the '80s.
     In the spirit of te fall season, I decided to follow a spooky theme with an old house where someone may, or may not be living.
     Through we follow a group of 4: Steph, Chelsea, Niyanna, and Mel. Each have their own personalities, and opinions.
     Steph is hard-headed, and loves adventure, often referrencing the supernatural.
     Chelsea is forward thinking, and passionate for the truth.
     Niyanna is the level-head, often telling things as they are, or how they should be.
     And finally, Mel. She is the quirky, shy, day-dreamer, and is also the view-point of this whole story.
     Here we get multiple choices for Mel each varying depending on the cuttent page's situation. Every choice is important.
     And each can lead to a different ending.
     How many are there?
     I'm not entirely sure.
     But for now, there are 2 confirmed endings; BAD & WIMP.
     To get either of these endings is simple. For the BAD ending, Mel has to refuse to check out the house.
     Doing this will have Mel watch her friends enter the house, and never come out.
     For the WIMP ending, Mel has to enter the house, and them immediently leave out of fear.
     </p>
     <p>It's simple, but each page has dialogue, and character for everyone. Like I said, I like to write stories.
     Will I continue it? Maybe. I'm kind of interested in seeing where this goes, for even I don't know the ending.
     I often left the characters speak for themselves once I have them laid out. Steven King does the same thing.
     Plus I'm a sucker to knowing everything about a character. For example, I wanna know if they like tea, coffee, or neither.
     It may seem small and insignificant, but it can speak volumes about someone and that's exactly what I like to do.
     So we'll see...maybe they will make it...maybe they won't. It all depends on what the reader wants Mel to do.
     </p>
