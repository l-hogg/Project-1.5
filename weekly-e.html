     <h1>Weekly:e</h1>
     <h2>October 8th, 2023</h2>
<p>This week was a lot when it came to CSS. There are so many ways to make things work with the help of CSS.
Attaching images, building boxes, and even making sections drop down. It's a lot to think about when designing
a website. So many options, and possibilities. Which is why it's been good to look at some examples of what could be 
useful when building a website. There have been a few ideas I've had, including some changing in images, or at 
least have them change colour when the mouse is hovered over it. 
     I want there to be an old, either retro, or vintage look to it, while keeping it modern. Perhaps I'd add 
a few of my own sketches, and art designs for flare. All it comes down to is placement, knowing how to make 
everything to work together without feeling out of place. I have a few sketches in mind, but there hasn't been
anything solid that I truly like. I'll get there eventually.
</p>
<p>While I think about this project, I do have some interesting things going on this week. Such as tomorrow,
I have a meeting with a group in the morning as I get the chance to go to "SpaceJunk" which is an animation
studio who focuses on commercials for various companies from sports, to banking to food corporations. It's 
actually going to be quite fascinating to see how this company works from beginning to end.
