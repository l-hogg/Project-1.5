<h1>Weekly:h</h1>
<body  style="background-color: #0d161c;">
     <p>Well, another week has gone, and we're another step closer to the end of the year.
     We worked on the JavaScript with the "drawing" assignment. It was a little difficult to 
     work with as there were so many factors. And lots of things can be rearranged, but by missing
     one position can completely mess with the written code.
     </p>
     <p>When I put together my JavaScript assignment, it actually came together better than I would
     have expected. It was really cool to see how the animation worked together with the added shapes.
     Then is came down to editing the lines, and even colours. I did have issues with the "Let..." And
     "if...then.." functions. I understand how it all works together fundamentally, but when it came 
     down to practical it wasn't quite working out. 
     </p>
