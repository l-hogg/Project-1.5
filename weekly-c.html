     <h1>Weekly C </h1>
     <br>
     <p>This is the week where CSS comes into play, and I've forgotten how
     difficult it is. There are so many extra steps to take when building widt
     HTML and CSS together. Just imagine when we hit Java...</p>
     <p>Alas once muscle memory, and messing with the w3schools website to gain 
     a better understanding, things should be smooth sailing, I hope.</p>
     <p>This whole box thing is a little confusing. And seeing those website 
     examples shows that it can be done...however it just goes over my head 
     when I inspect the page and see all this extra coding. So you just know
     it's going to be fun.</p>
     <br>
     <br>
     <p>In other news, everything else has gone well. Classes are breezing 
     along just fine, with little to no resistance, but then again, it's 
     still September. What I do like is the fact that many of these classes 
     allow for personal growth, no matter the stage. It's quite refreshing.
     Of course there are some courses that keep everything in a linear 
     route, but those classes are for some histocial base.<p>
     <br>
     <br>
     <p>I wonder if I will continue my little "make your own adventure" story.
     To be honest, I haven't really thought of much beyond what I wrote, but I'm 
     sure if I just gave it some thought I could come up with something easily. See,
     I like to write stories. Something to keep people entertained by. I'm sure this
     little horror flick could do something like that. I did have fun with it. But
     what's funny even more, is the fact that I don't really like horror stuff.
     Not the extreme things anyway like, SAW. I'm more of a suspense, who-done-it 
     murder mystery kind of gal. I dunno, we'll see what happens this week.</p>
